# 📰 News API

## 🧩 About the Project

**News API** is a web application for browsing and reading news from various sources across the Internet.  
It’s built using **TypeScript**, **Webpack**, and **modular JavaScript architecture**, following strict type-safety and code-quality rules.

The main goal of the project was to **migrate an existing JavaScript application to TypeScript**, configure the build tools, and ensure the app remains fully functional, responsive, and easy to maintain.
