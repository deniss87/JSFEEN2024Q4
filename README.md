# 🎯 Hangman

## 🕹️ About the Project

**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game built with **HTML**, **CSS (Sass)**, and **JavaScript**.  
The goal is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.  
Each incorrect guess brings the character one step closer to being "hanged" — can you save them in time?

This project focuses on **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **JavaScript logic** for game state management.
